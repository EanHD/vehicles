Chain drive to rear axle. Open two-seat touring body. Brass radiator, oil/kerosene lamps, hand-crank starting, no brakes on front wheels. Wooden-spoke artillery wheels. Only ~37 Model B vehicles produced. Difficulty modifier 1.5 (highest) reflects turn-of-century construction, extreme rarity, pioneering technology, hand-crafted components, wooden construction, and virtually no parts availability.
