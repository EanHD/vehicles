## Wikipedia Cross-Reference (North American Models)

Checking Wikipedia "List of Buick vehicles" for any missing NA models...

### Current Production (confirmed on Wikipedia)
✅ Enclave
✅ Encore GX
✅ Envision
✅ Envista

### Recently Discontinued (2010s-2020s)
✅ Verano
✅ Regal
✅ LaCrosse
✅ Encore (original)
✅ Cascada

### Verification Notes:
- **Electra EV**: China-market only (E4, E5, L7, etc.) - NOT North American, should NOT be added
- **GL6/GL8**: China-market MPVs - NOT North American, should NOT be added
- **Velite series**: China-market electric/hybrid - NOT North American, should NOT be added

## Missing Models Check

Scanning Wikipedia for NA models not in CHECKLIST.md:

### Potential Gaps to Investigate:
1. **1970s**: Century (standalone, not just with Regal)
2. **1980s**: Century (1982-1996 FWD generation separate from Regal)
3. **1990s**: Verify Century coverage is adequate
4. **2000s**: Check if all crossover/SUV coverage is complete

### Models that may need generation splits:
- Century (multiple distinct generations 1936-2005)
- Skylark (multiple generations with gaps)
- Special (multiple eras)
- Regal (multiple platforms)

---

## Preliminary Verdict

⚠️ **CHECKLIST.md appears mostly complete but needs verification of:**

1. Century generation coverage (very long-running model with multiple distinct eras)
2. Any missing transitional models from 1970s-1980s downsizing era
3. Verify China-only Electra EV models are correctly excluded from research scope

**RECOMMENDATION**: 
- Proceed with research using CHECKLIST.md as base
- During research, cross-reference each decade against Wikipedia to catch any gaps
- Focus on North American market vehicles only
- Document any discrepancies found during research

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create wip/buick/ directory
2. ✅ Create CHECKLIST_VERIFICATION.md (this file)
3. ⏳ Create PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
4. ⏳ Begin Phase 1 research (1980s-2020s modern vehicles)
5. ⏳ Validate each decade against Wikipedia during research
6. ⏳ Update CHECKLIST.md if missing models are discovered
