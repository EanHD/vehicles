- ✅ Archived completed decade files with `_APPENDED` suffix
- ✅ Verified entry counts after merge

### Quality Standards Met ✅
- ✅ All entries include all required fields
- ✅ All difficulty_modifier values justified
- ✅ Hybrid/diesel flags accurate

## Conclusion

Phase 1 is **60% complete** (3 of 5 decades). The 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s have been successfully researched, validated, and appended to vehicles.json. The workflow is well-established and ready for continuation with the 1990s and 1980s decades.

**Next Agent Action**: Begin 1990s research by creating `wip/ford/1990s.json` and following the same workflow pattern.
