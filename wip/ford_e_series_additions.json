Based on Super Duty frame. 6.8L Triton V10 (modular engine, not overhead cam). Twin I-beam front suspension, leaf spring rear. 158-inch or 178-inch wheelbase options. GVWR 9,500-14,500 lbs depending on configuration. Mobile mechanic note: Upfitter electrical systems vary widely - always check wiring diagrams before work. 6.8L V10 uses standard spark plugs (not 2-piece like 5.4L). Transmission cooler failure common on high-GVWR applications - check for fluid in radiator. Commercial-duty brake system with larger calipers.

Used for Class C motorhomes, large shuttle buses, commercial box trucks. 178-inch wheelbase standard. Dual rear wheels. Hydraulic brakes (not air) with commercial-duty calipers and rotors. Mobile mechanic note: E-450 commonly has aftermarket air suspension on RV applications - check for leaks at air springs and compressor. V10 requires 7 quarts oil (conventional 5W-20 or synthetic). Transmission service critical - many upfitter bodies add significant weight. Check for overheating issues on transmission and rear differential. Higher difficulty due to commercial specifications and varied upfitter equipment. Data sourced from Wikipedia Ford E-Series article, January 2025 revision."
