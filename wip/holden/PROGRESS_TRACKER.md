# Holden Progress Tracker

## Current Status
**Current vehicles.json count**: 0 entries
**Started**: January 2025

## Coverage Strategy
Australian GM brand. Only Pontiac G8/Chevy SS/Chevy Caprice PPV were Holden imports to US.
These are already in Pontiac/Chevrolet entries. Holden as standalone brand had NO official US sales.

## Status: NO ENTRIES NEEDED
Holden vehicles sold in US were rebadged as Pontiac/Chevrolet and already captured.
