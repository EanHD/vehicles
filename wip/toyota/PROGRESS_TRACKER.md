## Strategy: North American Focus

**Toyota is MASSIVE globally, so focusing on:**
- Models sold in North American market
- High-volume sellers (Camry, Corolla, RAV4, Tacoma, Tundra)
- Iconic models (Supra, Land Cruiser, 4Runner)
- Hybrid pioneers (Prius)
- Key generations only (not every single year)

**Skipping:**
- Japan/Asia-only models (Century, Allion, Alphard)
- Small kei cars (Pixis, Roomy)
- Regional variants not sold in NA
