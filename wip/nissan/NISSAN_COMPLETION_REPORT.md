## 3. Difficulty Modifier Distribution
- **1.0 (Standard Complexity):** 45 entries (e.g., Versa C11, B210 Sunny, Vanette C20).
- **1.1 (Moderate Complexity):** 28 entries — models with turbocharging, CVT/ADAS, or early EFI (Altima L34, Titan A60, Murano Z50/Z51).
- **1.2 (Elevated Complexity):** 17 entries — EVs (Leaf ZE1, Ariya), turbo performance platforms (370Z, 300ZX Z32), classic roadsters (Fairlady SP/SR), body-on-frame SUVs (Pathfinder WD21).
- **1.3 (High Complexity):** 6 entries — Motorex Skyline GT-R (RB26DETT), Patrol 60, vintage Type 11/12/13 trucks with mechanical brakes and limited parts support.

Each modifier is justified in the entry notes with service considerations (e.g., high-voltage systems, HICAS steering, SU carb tuning, or grey-market compliance).

## 6. Data Integrity & Validation
- All decade files passed `jq empty` prior to merge; `vehicles.json` validated post-append on October 14, 2025.
- Backup created as `vehicles.json.backup_20251014_*` prior to merge.
- Entry count verification confirms **96 Nissan records** now present in `vehicles.json`.

---

## 7. Follow-Up Actions
- Monitor Wikipedia for updates to 2026 model year announcements (e.g., Murano AWD standardization, Ariya battery revisions, Titan successor plans).
- Schedule periodic spot-check (quarterly) to ensure Nissan electrified lineup additions (e.g., potential Ariya refresh or e-POWER imports) are captured promptly.
