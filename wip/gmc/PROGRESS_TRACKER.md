## Notes

- **Platform Sharing**: Many GMC models share platforms with Chevrolet (Sierra/Silverado, Yukon/Tahoe, etc.). Reference Chevrolet entries for engine/transmission info but verify GMC-specific differences.
- **Denali Trim**: Starting in late 1990s, many GMC models added Denali luxury trim. Document when relevant.
- **Professional Grade**: GMC's brand positioning focuses on trucks/SUVs vs Chevrolet's broader lineup.
