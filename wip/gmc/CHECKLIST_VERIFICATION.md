## Issues Found:

### 1. **Missing Decade Entries**
The following models are mentioned in category lists but NOT in their appropriate decade sections:

- **S-15 Jimmy (1983–2005)** → Should be in 1980s section
- **Envoy XL (2002–2006)** → Should be in 2000s section
- **Envoy XUV (2004–2005)** → Should be in 2000s section

### 2. **Incomplete Sierra Coverage**
Sierra is only mentioned as "GMT900 generation (2007–2013)" in 2000s, but Sierra has been produced since 1988:
- Sierra GMT400 (1988–1998) → Should be in 1980s/1990s
- Sierra GMT800 (1999–2006) → Should be in 1990s/2000s
- Sierra GMT900 (2007–2013) → Already listed
- Sierra K2XX (2014–2018) → Already listed
- Sierra T1XX (2019–present) → Already listed

### 3. **Tracker Placement**
Tracker is mentioned in "Other notable vehicles" but should be in 1980s/1990s decades

### 4. **Astro Clarification Needed**
Need to verify if GMC actually sold the Astro van or if this is an error (Astro was primarily Chevrolet)

### 5. **Savana Dates**
Wikipedia says Savana (1996–2003) but CHECKLIST.md says (1996–present). Need to verify current production status.

## Action Items:

1. ✅ Add S-15 Jimmy to 1980s section
2. ✅ Add complete Sierra generations to appropriate decades
3. ✅ Move Tracker to 1980s/1990s section
4. ✅ Add Envoy XL and Envoy XUV to 2000s section
5. ⚠️ Verify Astro - likely a Chevrolet-only model, remove from GMC if confirmed
6. ⚠️ Verify Savana production dates

---

## Recommendation:

**DO NOT mark GMC as complete in CHECKLIST_STATUS.md until:**
1. All missing models are added to decade sections in CHECKLIST.md
2. All discrepancies are resolved
3. Wikipedia verification is complete for each model
4. vehicles.json entries are created for all models

**Current GMC Status**: INCOMPLETE - needs CHECKLIST.md corrections before data entry begins
