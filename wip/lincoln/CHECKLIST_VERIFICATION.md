## MISSING MODELS CHECK:

### Potential Gaps to Investigate:

1. **Aviator First Generation (2003-2005)**:
   CHECKLIST shows: "Aviator (2020‚Äìpresent)"
   ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING FIRST GENERATION! Need to add Aviator (2003-2005)
   
2. **Navigator Generations**:
   Need to verify all 4 generations are distinct:
   - Gen 1: 1998-2002
   - Gen 2: 2003-2006
   - Gen 3: 2007-2017
   - Gen 4: 2018-present
   CHECKLIST shows multiple entries - GOOD ‚úÖ

3. **Zephyr vs MKZ**:
   CHECKLIST shows: "Zephyr/MKZ (2006‚Äì2012)"
   This is correct - Zephyr was renamed MKZ ‚úÖ

4. **Continental Generations**:
   CHECKLIST shows multiple Continental entries - GOOD ‚úÖ

---

## CRITICAL FINDING:

‚ö†Ô∏è **AVIATOR FIRST GENERATION (2003-2005) IS MISSING!**

This is a common SUV that will definitely come into shop!
- Body-on-frame SUV based on Ford Explorer
- V8 engines
- 2003-2005 production
- Many still in service

**MUST ADD**:
- Lincoln Aviator (First generation, 2003-2005)

---

## SERVICE SHOP READINESS ASSESSMENT:

### Modern Vehicles (1980-2025):
- Coverage: ~95% (missing Aviator first gen)
- Priority vehicles: Well covered
- Common service models: All present except Aviator 2003-2005

### Historic Vehicles (pre-1980):
- Coverage: 100% per CHECKLIST.md
- Classic car capability: Comprehensive

---

## RECOMMENDATION:

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Add Lincoln Aviator (2003-2005, first generation) - CRITICAL GAP
2. Verify Aviator entry in CHECKLIST shows "Aviator (2003-2005, 2020‚Äìpresent)"

**THEN PROCEED WITH RESEARCH**:
Priority order for service shop:
1. Modern SUVs/Crossovers (Navigator, Aviator, MKX/Nautilus, MKC, Corsair)
2. Common sedans (Town Car, MKZ, Continental, LS)
3. Specialty (MKS, MKT, Mark LT, Blackwood)
4. Classic luxury (Mark series, Versailles, etc.)
5. Historic (pre-1980)
