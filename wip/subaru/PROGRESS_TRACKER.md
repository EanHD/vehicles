## Research Strategy

**Focus on North American Market Only** (1970s-2025)
- Subaru entered U.S. market in early 1970s with Leone (DL/GL)
- Known for symmetrical all-wheel-drive systems (standard on most models)
- Boxer engines (horizontally-opposed) across lineup
- WRX/STI performance variants with turbocharged engines
- Strong rally heritage and outdoor/adventure brand positioning
- Recent electrification: Crosstrek Hybrid, Solterra EV

## Key Technical Notes

**Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive (AWD):**
- Standard on most Subaru models (except BRZ)
- Longitudinal boxer engine layout with symmetrical drivetrain
- Improved traction, stability, and handling

**Boxer Engines (Horizontally-Opposed):**
- Lower center of gravity compared to inline/V-configuration engines
- EJ series (1989-present): 2.0L, 2.5L turbocharged and naturally aspirated
- FA/FB series (2012+): 2.0L, 2.4L direct injection
- EZ series (2000s): 3.0L, 3.6L six-cylinder engines

**Turbocharged Performance:**
- WRX: 2.0L or 2.5L turbo boxer
- WRX STI: High-performance variant with intercooler, upgraded turbo
- Higher difficulty_modifier due to turbo maintenance complexity

**Hybrid/Electric:**
- Crosstrek Hybrid (PHEV, 2019+)
- Solterra BEV (2023+): Co-developed with Toyota, e-TNGA platform
- Higher difficulty_modifier for high-voltage systems

**BRZ/Toyota Partnership:**
- Co-developed with Toyota (86/GR86)
- Rear-wheel drive (unique for modern Subaru)
- Naturally aspirated boxer engine

## Validation Checklist

Before marking decade as ✅ READY:
- [ ] All models have Wikipedia citations with revision dates
- [ ] `jq empty wip/subaru/[decade].json` passes
- [ ] All difficulty_modifier values ≥ 1.00 with justification
- [ ] Boxer engine configurations clearly documented
- [ ] AWD standard on most models (except BRZ) clearly noted
- [ ] Turbocharged models have appropriate difficulty_modifier
- [ ] Hybrid/EV models have appropriate difficulty_modifier
- [ ] All required fields present

## Next Steps

1. Start with **2020s** decade (most recent, clearest information)
2. Work backwards through 2010s, 2000s, 1990s, 1980s, 1970s
3. Validate each decade file before moving to next
4. Batch append all decades once validated
5. Create completion report

**Remember:**
- Use only Wikipedia as source
- Cite all sources with revision dates
- Validate with `jq empty` before proceeding
- Update this tracker in real-time
- Backup before appending to vehicles.json
