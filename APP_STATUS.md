## 🎯 Current State

The Streamlit web application is now **RUNNING** and fully functional at:
- **Local URL**: http://localhost:8501
- **Network URL**: http://172.31.17.60:8501
- **External URL**: http://73.151.108.165:8501

### What's Working

✅ **Data Layer**
- 2,270 vehicles loaded from `data/vehicles.json`
- 153 services loaded from `data/services.json`
- Both JSON files validated and accessible

✅ **Web Interface**
- Streamlit app running on port 8501
- Three-column selection interface:
  1. Select Vehicle (Make → Model → Year)
  2. Vehicle Details (engines, transmission, body styles)
  3. Select Service (by category)

✅ **AI Integration**
- Multi-provider support via `tools/ai_client.py`
- Environment variables configured in `.env`:
  - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` (for research with web access)
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for formatting)
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (for formatting backup)

✅ **Document Generation**
- Service documentation generator ready
- HTML output with professional styling
- Caching system to avoid redundant generation
- Research AI + Formatter AI hybrid approach

## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### Issue #1: File Path Error
**Problem**: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../data/vehicles.json'`  
**Solution**: Updated `tools/service_doc_generator.py` to use absolute paths relative to project root:
```python
project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent
vehicles_db = str(project_root / "data" / "vehicles.json")
services_db = str(project_root / "data" / "services.json")
```

### Issue #2: Service Name KeyError
**Problem**: `KeyError: 'name'` - services.json has mixed schemas (some use 'name', others 'service_name')  
**Solution**: Updated `app.py` with helper function to handle both schemas:
```python
def get_service_name(s):
    return s.get('name') or s.get('service_name', 'Unknown')
```
