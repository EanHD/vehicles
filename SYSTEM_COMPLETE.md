## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Smart Caching System

```
User Request → Cache Check
               ├─ Hit → Return instant (FREE)
               └─ Miss → Generate ($0.01-0.06)
                         ├─ Research (Perplexity)
                         ├─ Format (GPT-4o-mini)
                         └─ Cache for next time
```

**Result:** First generation is slow/paid, all subsequent are instant/free!

### Hybrid AI Approach

**Why it works:**
- Perplexity for research (web access, accurate)
- GPT-4o-mini for formatting (fast, cheap)
- Best of both worlds: quality + cost-effectiveness

**Cost per document:**
- First generation: $0.01-0.06
- Cached retrieval: $0.00

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### What's Safe

✅ **API keys in .env** (gitignored, not committed)
✅ **Local data storage** (your machine, your control)
✅ **Tailscale encryption** (private network access)
✅ **No PII collected** (only vehicle specs queried)

### What Goes to Cloud

- Research queries (vehicle specs + service type)
- AI responses (procedures, torque specs)
- Nothing else!

### Best Practices

1. Don't commit .env file
2. Use Tailscale for mobile access (not public internet)
3. Rotate API keys periodically
4. Backup cache and database regularly
