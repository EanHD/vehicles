## How It Works

### User Flow

```
1. User navigates to 💬 AI Assistant page
2. Selects a cached document to edit
3. Types request: "Add oil drain plug torque: 18 ft-lbs"
4. Assistant:
   - Analyzes intent
   - Extracts information to add
   - Verifies with web research
   - Provides confidence score
5. If high confidence (≥80%): Recommends adding
6. If medium (50-79%): Requests source upload
7. If low (<50%): Rejects with guidance
8. User confirms: "yes"
9. Assistant applies edit to document
```

## Key Features

### 1. Intent Analysis
- Classifies user requests into categories
- Routes to appropriate handlers
- Extracts target section and topic

### 2. Verification System
Two verification methods:
- **Web Research** - Uses Perplexity AI with web access
- **Source Upload** - Verifies against user-provided documents

### 3. Confidence Scoring
- ✅ **High (≥80%)** - Recommend adding
- ⚠️ **Medium (50-79%)** - Request source
- ❌ **Low (<50%)** - Reject with guidance

### 4. Source Upload
Supports:
- URLs (working)
- Text/Paste (working)
- PDF documents (planned)
- Images/Screenshots (planned)

### 5. Document Editing
- Parses HTML with BeautifulSoup
- Finds target sections
- Inserts new content
- Preserves structure

## Token Optimization

Typical edit costs:
- Intent analysis: ~100-200 tokens
- Verification: ~500-1000 tokens
- **Total: ~$0.001-0.003 per edit**

Compare to general chat:
- Unfocused conversation: ~5000+ tokens
- **10-50x more expensive**

## Integration

### With Existing System
- ✅ Uses existing `AIClient` infrastructure
- ✅ Compatible with `ServiceDocGenerator`
- ✅ Works with cache system
- ✅ No breaking changes

### Deployment
- ✅ Committed to git (commit a052e59)
- ✅ Pushed to main branch
- ✅ Will auto-deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- ✅ Dependencies automatically installed

## Testing Done

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Python syntax check passed
- ✅ Import checks passed
- ✅ File structure verified
- ✅ Git integration tested

### Ready for User Testing
- Document selection
- Intent analysis
- Verification workflow
- Source upload
- Document editing

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   cd /home/eanhd/projects/vehicles
   source venv/bin/activate
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Navigate to 💬 AI Assistant**
