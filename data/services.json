Never work under vehicle supported only by jack.\n\n**Pre-Work Checks:**\n- Verify correct brake pad part number for vehicle make/model/year\n- Check brake fluid level and condition (should be clear amber, not dark brown)\n- Inspect brake lines for leaks, cracks, or corrosion\n- Confirm rotor thickness meets minimum specification (typically 10mm minimum)\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Loosen lug nuts 1/2 turn before raising vehicle.\n2. Raise vehicle and secure with jack stands at manufacturer-specified lift points.\n3. Remove wheel and inspect entire brake assembly for abnormal wear, leaks, or damage.\n4. Remove caliper mounting bolts (typically 2 bolts, 14-17mm, torque spec 25-35 ft-lb).\n5. Secure caliper with mechanic's wire—NEVER let caliper hang by brake hose.\n6. Remove old brake pads and anti-rattle clips; note wear pattern for diagnostic reference.\n7. Inspect caliper slide pins for binding; clean and re-lubricate with high-temp synthetic brake grease.\n8. Compress caliper piston slowly using C-clamp or brake caliper tool. Monitor brake fluid reservoir—may overflow if full.\n9. Install new brake pad wear sensors if equipped (critical for warning light function).\n10. Install new anti-rattle clips and brake pads with chamfered edges toward rotor face.\n11. Apply thin coat of brake grease to pad backing plates (NOT friction surface).\n12. Reinstall caliper and torque bolts to specification (typically 25-35 ft-lb—verify in service manual).\n13. Pump brake pedal slowly until firm before attempting to move vehicle.\n14. Perform bedding procedure: 30 gentle stops from 30 mph with 30-second cool-down between stops.\n15. Recheck all mounting bolts and brake fluid level after test drive.\n\n**Critical Torque Specifications (verify for specific vehicle):**\n- Caliper mounting bolts: 25-35 ft-lb (sliding calipers), 70-90 ft-lb (fixed calipers)\n- Caliper bracket bolts: 70-90 ft-lb\n- Wheel lug nuts: 80-100 ft-lb (aluminum wheels), 90-120 ft-lb (steel wheels)\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Compressing piston too quickly can damage ABS hydraulic control unit\n- Failing to lubricate slide pins causes binding and uneven pad wear\n- Not pumping brake pedal before moving vehicle (NO BRAKES!)\n- Contaminating friction surface with grease reduces braking effectiveness\n- Overtorquing caliper mounting bolts can strip threads or break bolts\n\n**Post-Service Verification:**\n- Brake pedal should be firm within 2-3 pumps\n- No leaks around caliper or brake lines\n- No grinding, squealing (beyond initial break-in), or vibration\n- Warning lights off (may require scan tool to clear codes)\n- Test stops from 20-30 mph in safe area show straight, firm stopping",
    "customer_facing_notes": "### What This Service Includes\nFront brake pad replacement with high-quality pads meeting or exceeding OEM specifications. Includes caliper inspection, slide pin lubrication, and proper break-in procedure.\n\n### Why It Matters\nBrake pads are the primary friction component that stops your vehicle. Worn brake pads reduce stopping power, damage rotors, and compromise safety. Fresh brake pads restore confident braking and protect expensive rotor replacement. The front brakes typically handle 60-70% of braking force.\n\n### What To Expect\nEstimated time: 1.0 hour. We'll come to your location with all necessary tools and equipment. You may notice some brake dust for the first few days—this is normal as new pads bed-in to rotors.\n\n### After The Visit\n**First 200 Miles (Break-In Period):**\n- Avoid hard braking when possible—use gentle, gradual stops\n- Avoid high-speed highway braking\n- This allows pads to properly mate with rotor surface\n- Braking performance improves as break-in completes\n\n**Normal Operation:**\n- Slight brake dust on wheels is normal\n- Brakes should feel firm and responsive\n- No grinding, squealing (beyond occasional light squeaking in damp conditions), or vibration\n- If you notice any concerning sounds or reduced braking, contact us immediately—don't delay with brake concerns\n\nQuestions?

    "notes": "**Oil Change (Conventional Oil) - Standard Procedure**\n\nSafety: Work on cool engine. Wear nitrile gloves to prevent burns and skin contact with used oil.\n\n**Pre-Service Verification:**\n- Confirm oil viscosity grade from owner's manual or door jamb sticker (e.g., 5W-30, 10W-30)\n- Verify oil capacity (typically 4-6 quarts for 4-cylinder, 5-8 quarts for V6/V8)\n- Confirm filter part number matches vehicle application\n- Check for oil leaks, damage, or modifications\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Run engine 2-3 minutes to warm oil (improves flow and contaminant suspension).\n2. Raise vehicle safely using lift or jack/stands at proper lift points.\n3. Place drain pan (minimum 8-quart capacity) under drain plug.\n4. Remove drain plug using correct size wrench/socket (typically 13-17mm).\n5. Allow 10-15 minutes for complete drainage—do not rush.\n6. Inspect drain plug and washer/gasket; replace if damaged or per manufacturer requirement (Honda requires new washer each change).\n7. Clean drain plug threads and magnetic tip if equipped.\n8. Reinstall drain plug with new washer; torque to specification (typically 25-30 ft-lb for 13mm, 20-25 ft-lb for 14mm).\n9. Locate oil filter—may be cartridge type or spin-on canister type.\n10. Remove old filter using filter wrench; verify o-ring comes off with filter.\n11. Clean filter mounting surface with lint-free shop towel.\n12. Apply thin coat of clean new oil to new filter gasket/o-ring.\n13. Install new filter per instructions:\n    - Spin-on: hand-tight plus 3/4 turn\n    - Cartridge: follow torque specification (typically 18-25 ft-lb)\n14. Lower vehicle and add specified oil quantity MINUS 1/2 quart (prevents overfilling).\n15. Start engine and run 60-90 seconds while monitoring for leaks.\n16. Shut off engine, wait 2-3 minutes for oil to settle.\n17. Check oil level on dipstick—should be between MIN and MAX marks.\n18. Add remaining oil in 1/2-quart increments to reach proper level.\n19. Recheck for leaks around drain plug and filter.\n20. Reset oil life monitor per vehicle-specific procedure (typically via steering wheel controls or accelerator pedal sequence).\n21. Install reminder sticker with date, mileage, and next service due.\n\n**Disposal:**\nPour used oil into sealed container and take to auto parts store or recycling center.

    "customer_facing_notes": "### What This Service Includes\nComplete oil change using quality conventional motor oil and new oil filter. Includes 19-point courtesy inspection, fluid level check, tire pressure adjustment, and oil life monitor reset.\n\n### Why It Matters\nRegular oil changes are THE most important maintenance for engine longevity. Oil lubricates moving parts, removes contaminants, cools internal components, and prevents sludge buildup. Fresh oil every 3,000-5,000 miles helps engines last 200,000+ miles.\n\n### What To Expect\nEstimated time: 30 minutes. We come to your location with all necessary supplies—oil, filter, tools, and disposal container for used oil. No need to visit a shop or wait in a lobby.\n\n**Conventional Oil Service Intervals:**\n- Normal driving: Every 5,000 miles or 6 months\n- Severe service (short trips, city driving, towing): Every 3,000 miles or 3 months\n- Older vehicles (pre-2000): Every 3,000 miles recommended\n\n### After The Visit\nYour next oil change is due in 3,000-5,000 miles or 3-6 months, whichever comes first. We'll install a reminder sticker on your windshield. Check oil level monthly—park on level ground, wait 5 minutes after engine off, then check dipstick. Oil should be light amber/brown (not black) and at the MAX mark.\n\n**Signs You Need an Oil Change:**\n- Oil looks very dark or black\n- Low oil level on dipstick\n- Engine sounds louder than usual\n- Oil change light illuminated\n- 3,000+ miles since last change\n\nQuestions? Contact us anytime. Consistent oil changes are the key to engine longevity.",

    "notes": "**Oil Change (Synthetic Oil) - Premium Service**\n\nSafety: Work on cool engine. Wear nitrile gloves to prevent burns and skin contact with used oil.\n\n**Pre-Service Verification:**\n- Confirm synthetic oil specification (e.g., 0W-20, 5W-30 full synthetic)\n- Many modern vehicles REQUIRE synthetic oil—verify owner's manual\n- Verify oil capacity and filter part number\n- Check for oil leaks or engine modifications\n\n**Synthetic Oil Benefits:**\n- Extended drain intervals (typically 7,500-10,000 miles vs. 3,000-5,000 for conventional)\n- Better high-temperature protection\n- Improved cold-start flow\n- Enhanced engine cleanliness\n- Better fuel economy\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Run engine 2-3 minutes to warm oil for better flow.\n2. Raise vehicle safely at proper lift points.\n3. Place drain pan (8+ quart capacity) under drain plug.\n4. Remove drain plug using correct size wrench (typically 13-17mm).\n5. Allow 10-15 minutes for complete drainage—synthetic oil flows more easily.\n6. Inspect drain plug and washer; replace washer if required by manufacturer.\n7. Clean drain plug threads and magnetic tip.\n8. Reinstall drain plug with new washer if required; torque to specification (typically 25-30 ft-lb).\n9. Remove old oil filter—cartridge or spin-on type.\n10. Clean filter mounting surface thoroughly.\n11. Apply thin coat of NEW SYNTHETIC oil to new filter gasket/o-ring.\n12. Install new filter:\n    - Spin-on: hand-tight plus 3/4 turn\n    - Cartridge: torque to specification (18-25 ft-lb typical)\n13. Lower vehicle and add specified synthetic oil quantity MINUS 1/2 quart.\n14. Start engine and run 60-90 seconds—synthetic oil circulates quickly.\n15. Shut off engine, wait 2-3 minutes for oil to settle.\n16. Check oil level on dipstick—should be between marks.\n17. Add remaining oil to proper level.\n18. Verify no leaks around drain plug and filter.\n19. Reset oil life monitor to 100%.\n20. Install reminder sticker noting SYNTHETIC oil and extended interval.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Never mix synthetic and conventional oils (different additive packages)\n- Use only oils meeting vehicle manufacturer specifications (e.g., GM dexos1, Ford WSS-M2C946-A)\n- Synthetic oil may reveal existing leaks as it penetrates seals more effectively\n- Extended drain intervals require highway driving—severe service (city/short trips) requires shorter intervals\n\n**Disposal:**\nSynthetic oil recycles just like conventional—take to auto parts store or recycling center.\n\n**Torque Specifications:**\n- Drain plug: 20-30 ft-lb (verify for specific vehicle)\n- Cartridge filter housing: 18-25 ft-lb\n- Spin-on filter: hand-tight plus 3/4 turn\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Using wrong synthetic oil specification voids warranty\n- Assuming all synthetic intervals are 10,000 miles (verify manual)\n- Mixing conventional and synthetic compromises protection\n- Not documenting synthetic oil use for warranty purposes\n\n**Post-Service Verification:**\n- Oil level correct on dipstick\n- No leaks after 5-minute idle\n- Oil pressure light off immediately\n- Oil life monitor shows 100%\n- Service sticker notes \"FULL SYNTHETIC\" and proper next service interval",
    "customer_facing_notes": "### What This Service Includes\nComplete oil change using premium full synthetic motor oil and quality oil filter. Includes 19-point courtesy inspection, fluid level check, tire pressure adjustment, and oil life monitor reset.\n\n### Why It Matters\nSynthetic oil provides superior engine protection compared to conventional oil. It flows better in cold weather, resists breakdown in extreme heat, keeps engines cleaner, and lasts longer. Modern engines with tight tolerances benefit significantly from synthetic oil's advanced formulation. Many newer vehicles REQUIRE synthetic oil to maintain warranty coverage.\n\n### What To Expect\nEstimated time: 30 minutes. We bring everything needed to your location—oil, filter, drain pan, and disposal container. Synthetic oil service typically costs 40-60% more than conventional oil but lasts nearly twice as long, making it cost-effective.\n\n**Synthetic Oil Advantages:**\n- Extended drain intervals (7,500-10,000 miles typical vs. 3,000-5,000 for conventional)\n- Better fuel economy (1-2% improvement)\n- Faster engine starts in cold weather\n- Enhanced high-temperature protection\n- Cleaner engine internals\n\n### After The Visit\nYour next oil change is due in approximately 7,500-10,000 miles or 6-12 months (whichever comes first). We'll provide a reminder based on your driving habits. Check oil level monthly using the dipstick—it should stay near the MAX mark between changes. Monitor for leaks under your parking spot.\n\n**Note:** If you drive primarily short trips (under 10 miles), tow trailers, or drive in extreme conditions, follow \"severe service\" schedule (5,000-7,500 miles) even with synthetic oil.\n\nQuestions? We're here to help keep your engine running strong for 200,000+ miles.",
