## üîÑ Regenerate Old Documents

To get the improvements in existing documents:

```bash
cd /home/eanhd/projects/vehicles
source venv/bin/activate
python << 'EOF'
from tools.service_doc_generator import ServiceDocGenerator

gen = ServiceDocGenerator(enable_diagrams=True)

# Regenerate specific document
doc_path, from_cache = gen.generate(
    year=2015,
    make="Toyota", 
    model="Camry",
    service="Oil Change",
    force_regenerate=True  # Force regeneration
)
print(f"‚úÖ Regenerated: {doc_path}")
EOF
```

Or just delete the old HTML file from Browse Cache and regenerate through the UI!

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always verify torque specs** - AI researches them but factory manual is authoritative
2. **Diagrams are illustrative** - They help visualize but may not match exact vehicle configuration
3. **Use force regenerate** - If you need updated information or want the new styling
4. **Check dark mode** - Documents look great in both light and dark mode now!
5. **Cost monitoring** - Each document generation costs ~$0.02-0.05 depending on diagrams

---

## üêõ If You Find Issues

The system now has validation that will warn you:
- If torque specs are placeholders (contains `{value}` or `N/A`)
- If diagrams fail to generate
- If AI response can't be parsed

Check console output for these warnings!
