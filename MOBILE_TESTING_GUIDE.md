## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Text Too Small
**Solution**: Zoom in using browser controls. Font sizes should scale proportionally.

### Issue: Sidebar Too Wide
**Solution**: This is intentional (85vw) for better mobile UX. Can be adjusted in app.py if needed.

### Issue: Buttons Hard to Tap
**Solution**: All buttons should be minimum 44px tall. If not, report specific button.

### Issue: iOS Keyboard Covers Input
**Solution**: Scroll the page up, or tap elsewhere first. This is a browser limitation.

### Issue: Horizontal Scrolling on Home Page
**Solution**: Should not happen. If it does, report which section causes it.
