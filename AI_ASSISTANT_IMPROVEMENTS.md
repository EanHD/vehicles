# AI Assistant Improvements - Complete Guide

## Overview
Major improvements to the AI Service Assistant to make it excellent at answering questions, finding wiring diagrams, and helping with service documentation.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Intent Detection Improvements**
**Problem:** Assistant wasn't recognizing wiring diagram requests properly
**Solution:**
- Enhanced pattern matching for O2 sensors, ECM connections, and electrical components
- Added specific patterns for "sensor to ECM", "upstream/downstream", and common sensor abbreviations
- Improved question detection to route queries appropriately
- Default to "question" intent when unsure (more helpful than "general chat")

### 2. **Wiring Diagram Handler - Major Upgrade**
**Problem:** Generic responses, no context awareness, didn't actually help users
**Solution:**
- **Caching System:** Automatically saves wiring information to `wiring_diagrams/` directory
- **Cache Checking:** Checks if wiring info already exists before researching
- **Better Circuit Detection:** Recognizes "upstream O2 sensor to ECM" type queries
- **Comprehensive Research:** Uses detailed prompts to get:
  - Wire colors and gauges
  - Connector pin assignments
  - Voltage/resistance specs
  - Component locations
  - Common failure points
  - Testing procedures
- **User-Friendly Output:** Clear formatting with actionable next steps
- **Follow-up Support:** Users can ask additional questions about cached diagrams

### 3. **Question Handler Enhancement**
**Problem:** Wasn't actually loading document content to answer questions
**Solution:**
- Loads and parses actual HTML document
- Extracts text content (up to 8000 chars)
- Provides context-aware answers based on document sections
- Cites specific sections when answering

### 4. **UI/UX Improvements**
**New Features:**
- **Quick Action Buttons:** One-click access to common tasks
  - Get Wiring Info
  - List All Sections
  - Safety Info
  - Torque Specs
- **Helpful Tips:** Context-aware examples above chat
- **Better Prompts:** Dynamic chat placeholder based on loaded document
- **Sidebar Wiring Browser:** View all cached wiring diagrams
- **Status Indicators:** Clear feedback on loaded document and pending edits
- **Improved Instructions:** Better onboarding text explaining capabilities

### 5. **Better Error Messages**
- Specific suggestions when wiring lookup fails
- Example requests to guide users
- Alternative options (upload file, provide URL)

## How to Use the Improved Assistant

### Getting Wiring Diagrams

**Example Requests:**
```
"I need a wiring diagram showing the upstream O2 sensor to the ECM"
"Show me the oxygen sensor wiring"
"What are the wire colors for the upstream O2 sensor?"
"Find wiring for the fuel pump circuit"
"I need ECM connector pinout"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Assistant detects wiring request
2. Checks cache for existing information
3. If not cached, researches comprehensive wiring info
4. Saves to `wiring_diagrams/[Vehicle]_[Circuit]_wiring.txt`
5. Displays detailed information including:
   - Component identification
   - Wire colors and gauges
   - Connector details and pins
   - Voltage/resistance specs
   - Component locations
   - Common issues
   - Testing points

**Follow-up Options:**
- Ask specific questions: "What wire color goes to pin 3?"
- Add to document: "Add this to troubleshooting section"
- Request more circuits: "Now show me the starter circuit"

### Asking Questions About Documents

**Example Questions:**
```
"What are the safety precautions?"
"Show me all torque specifications"
"What sections are in this document?"
"How do I remove the oil filter?"
"What tools are needed?"
```

**How It Works:**
- Loads actual document content
- Searches relevant sections
- Provides specific answers with section references
- Offers to add missing information

### Editing Documents

**Example Edits:**
```
"Add torque spec: oil drain plug 18 ft-lbs"
"Update oil capacity to 5.5 quarts"
"Add troubleshooting tip for stuck drain plug"
```

**Process:**
1. AI extracts information and target section
2. Verifies accuracy via research (if no source provided)
3. Shows confidence score and verification summary
4. Asks for confirmation
5. Applies edit to HTML document

### Quick Actions (New!)

**One-Click Buttons:**
- üîå **Get Wiring Info** - Start wiring diagram lookup
- üìã **List All Sections** - See document structure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Info** - View safety precautions

## Troubleshooting

### "No wiring diagram found"
**Causes:**
- Circuit name too vague
- API rate limits
- Network issues

**Solutions:**
- Be more specific: "upstream O2 sensor" instead of "sensor"
- Try different phrasing
- Check API key and internet connection
- Retry after a moment

### Assistant not loading document
**Causes:**
- Document path changed
- File was deleted
- Cache corruption

**Solutions:**
- Regenerate document from Generate page
- Check Browse Cache for valid documents
- Click "Load Document" button after selection

### Wiring diagrams not appearing in sidebar
**Causes:**
- Directory doesn't exist
- Files have wrong extension

**Solutions:**
- Verify `/wiring_diagrams/` directory exists
- Check files end with `.txt`
- Refresh page

## API Costs Estimate

### Per Operation
- **Wiring Diagram Research (first time):** ~$0.01-0.02
- **Wiring Diagram (cached):** $0.00
- **Question:** ~$0.001-0.005
- **Document Edit:** ~$0.005-0.01

### Monthly Usage Estimate
**Typical Shop (100 repairs/month):**
- 50 wiring lookups √ó $0.015 = $0.75
- 200 questions √ó $0.003 = $0.60
- 30 edits √ó $0.008 = $0.24
- **Total:** ~$1.60/month

**Heavy Usage (500 repairs/month):**
- 200 wiring lookups √ó $0.015 = $3.00
- 800 questions √ó $0.003 = $2.40
- 100 edits √ó $0.008 = $0.80
- **Total:** ~$6.20/month

*Note: Caching dramatically reduces costs for repeat queries*

## Summary

The AI Assistant is now a powerful tool for:
‚úÖ Finding and caching wiring diagrams automatically
‚úÖ Answering questions about loaded service documents
‚úÖ Helping edit documents with verification
‚úÖ Providing context-aware assistance
‚úÖ Reducing repetitive research through caching

**Key Improvement:** The assistant now actually loads document context and can research + cache wiring information, making it genuinely useful for technicians.
