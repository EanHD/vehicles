- No way to edit documents from Browse Cache view

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added **4 action buttons** when viewing cached documents:
  - ‚¨áÔ∏è **Download** - Save HTML to device
  - üöÄ **View Full** - Open in new browser tab (works on Streamlit Cloud)
  - üñ®Ô∏è **Print** - Professional print dialog with optimized formatting
  - ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit in Assistant** - Load document directly into AI Assistant

**Key Features:**
- Print button uses JavaScript to open in new window with print dialog
- Automatically applies `@media print` CSS for clean print layout
- Full-width document preview (no more narrow column issue)
- Seamless transfer to AI Assistant for editing

### 2. ‚úÖ AI Assistant - Wiring Diagram Support

**Problem Solved:**
- No access to wiring diagrams without expensive subscriptions
- Difficult to find electrical circuit information quickly
- Wiring info not cached or organized

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Automatic wiring diagram detection** - AI recognizes requests like:
  - "Find wiring diagram for starter circuit"
  - "Get alternator wiring schematic"
  - "Show me fuel pump wiring"

**What It Provides:**
- Wire colors and gauges
- Connector types and locations
- Pin assignments
- Voltage/resistance specifications
- Fuse/relay locations
- Component locations
- Common failure points
- TSB references

**Automatic Caching:**
- All wiring info saved to `wiring_diagrams/` directory
- Filename format: `{Year}_{Make}_{Model}_{Circuit}_wiring.txt`
- Easy to reference for future jobs
- Token-efficient (only researched once per circuit)

### 3. ‚úÖ Documentation Updates

Created comprehensive documentation:
- **BROWSE_CACHE_AND_WIRING_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Complete technical documentation
- **QUICK_REFERENCE_WIRING.md** - Quick reference guide for users
- **AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md** - Updated with wiring diagram workflow
