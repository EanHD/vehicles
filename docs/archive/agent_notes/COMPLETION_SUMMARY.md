# ✅ Task Completion Summary

**Agent Session**: January 17, 2025  
**Task**: Fix errors and complete system setup  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 🎯 Tasks Completed

### 1. Fixed Critical Errors ✅

**Issue #1: FileNotFoundError**
- **Problem**: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../data/vehicles.json'`
- **Root Cause**: Relative path not working from app.py context
- **Solution**: Updated `tools/service_doc_generator.py` to use absolute paths:
  ```python
  project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent
  vehicles_db = str(project_root / "data" / "vehicles.json")
  services_db = str(project_root / "data" / "services.json")
  ```
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested

**Issue #2: KeyError 'name'**
- **Problem**: `KeyError: 'name'` when accessing services
- **Root Cause**: services.json has mixed schemas - some use 'name', others use 'service_name'
- **Solution**: Added helper function in `app.py`:
  ```python
  def get_service_name(s):
      return s.get('name') or s.get('service_name', 'Unknown')
  ```
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested
