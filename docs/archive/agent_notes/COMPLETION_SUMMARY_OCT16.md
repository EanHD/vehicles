## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. **Torque Specifications - CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT** ⚙️
**Issue:** Generic torque ranges (e.g., "25-30 ft-lbs") that could be incorrect for specific vehicles.

**Resolution:**
- ✅ AI now researches and returns exact factory specifications
- ✅ Added prominent warning banner about verifying specs
- ✅ Per-specification warning notes for critical components
- ✅ Validation system detects and warns about placeholder values
- ✅ Example: Toyota Camry now shows "27 ft-lbs" (exact factory spec) instead of "25-30 ft-lbs"

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Prevents potential damage from incorrect torque application

---

### 2. **HTML Styling - Common Issues Section** 🎨
**Issue:** Light text on light background made common issues section unreadable.

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Fixed CSS color inheritance for light mode
- ✅ Improved dark mode contrast (dark olive background with light text)
- ✅ Added explicit color rules for all text elements
- ✅ Tested in both light and dark modes

**Impact:** HIGH - Essential for usability

---

### 3. **AI Diagram Generation** 🖼️
**Issue:** Diagrams showing placeholder icons, no attribution, confusing presentation.

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Added "AI-Generated Diagrams" notice with green success banner
- ✅ Only show diagram section when diagrams actually exist
- ✅ Added error handling for missing images
- ✅ Improved styling with rounded corners and shadows
- ✅ 10 diagrams generated and working perfectly

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Enhances documentation quality and professionalism

**Cost:** ~$0.005 per diagram (very economical with Together AI FLUX.1-schnell)

---

### 4. **Sidebar UI Cleanup** 🧹
**Issue:** Confusing document icon with "0" at top of sidebar.

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Removed placeholder image
- ✅ Replaced with clean text header "🔧 Swoop Service Auto"
- ✅ Maintained functional metrics and navigation

**Impact:** LOW - Improves UI clarity

---

### 5. **Cache Management** 🗂️
**Issue:** Delete function had bugs, preview window too small.

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Fixed delete function to properly match cache entries by path
- ✅ Added confirmation dialog ("Are you sure?")
- ✅ Clear cache after deletion to refresh UI
- ✅ Increased preview height to 1200px
- ✅ Full-width preview display

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Essential for cache maintenance
