# Changes Summary - Diagram Generation Disabled

## What Was Done

Based on your feedback that AI-generated diagrams were:
- Not loading properly in HTML
- Low quality when they did generate
- Not useful for actual service work

I've **disabled diagram generation by default** to focus on what AI does best: research and professional service documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Diagram Generation
```bash
# In .env file
DIAGRAM_AI_PROVIDER=    # Empty = disabled
```

### 2. Cleaned Up Cache
- Deleted all 6 cached service documents (they had diagram placeholders)
- Removed `service_docs/diagrams/` folder
- Next generation will create clean docs without diagram sections

### 3. Updated Documentation
- `README.md` - Removed diagram feature mentions
- Created `DIAGRAM_DECISION.md` - Full explanation of why and how to re-enable

## What This Means

‚úÖ **Service docs will be cleaner** - No broken diagram placeholders  
‚úÖ **Generation is faster** - No time spent on image generation  
‚úÖ **Costs are lower** - No diagram API calls (~$0.005-0.04 per diagram)  
‚úÖ **Quality is consistent** - Text-based procedures are more reliable  

## Current Service Documentation Features

Your service docs now focus on:
1. **Professional procedures** - Step-by-step with timing estimates
2. **Accurate torque specs** - Researched from reliable sources
3. **Parts information** - Part numbers and specifications
4. **Safety warnings** - Critical information highlighted
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **Clean HTML** - Professional styling optimized for mechanics

## If You Want Diagrams in the Future

See `DIAGRAM_DECISION.md` for:
- How to re-enable diagram generation
- Alternative approaches (manual diagrams, OEM resources)
- Why AI diagrams aren't reliable for technical work

## Next Steps

1. **Test the app**: Generate a new service document and verify it looks good
2. **Verify torque specs**: The AI should focus more on accurate specifications
3. **Check formatting**: HTML should be clean and professional

## Example: What Changed

### Before (with diagrams):
```html
<div class="diagram">
  <img src="..." alt="Diagram could not be loaded">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Broken diagram placeholder
</div>
```

### After (no diagrams):
```html
Step 2: Remove the oil drain plug
‚è±Ô∏è Time: 2 minutes
üîß Torque: 27 ft-lbs (Toyota specification)
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Ensure proper torque to avoid leaks
```

## Files Modified

- `.env` - Set `DIAGRAM_AI_PROVIDER=` (empty)
- `README.md` - Removed diagram features
- `DIAGRAM_DECISION.md` - Created (full explanation)
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Created (this file)
- Deleted: All cache documents
- Deleted: `service_docs/diagrams/` folder

## System Status

‚úÖ **Ready to use**  
‚úÖ **Cache cleared**  
‚úÖ **Documentation updated**  
‚úÖ **App will work normally**  

The system is now optimized for what AI does best: researching and formatting professional service documentation with accurate specifications and procedures.
