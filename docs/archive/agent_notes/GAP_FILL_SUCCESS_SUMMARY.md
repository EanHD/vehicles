## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

While the dataset is now **production-ready**, these optional enhancements could be considered:

### Priority 2: Double-Check Coverage
- [ ] Toyota Camry V30 (1992-1996) - verify if gap exists
- [ ] Nissan Altima - verify all generations present
- [ ] Honda CR-V - verify all generations present
- [ ] Toyota RAV4 - verify all generations present

### Priority 3: Common SUVs
- [ ] Ford Explorer - verify complete coverage
- [ ] Jeep Wrangler TJ/JK/JL - verify all generations

### Priority 4: Performance Vehicles (Lower Volume)
- [ ] Ford Mustang - verify Foxbody through S650
- [ ] Chevrolet Corvette - verify C1-C8
- [ ] Dodge Challenger/Charger - verify all generations

**Note**: These are lower priority since the critical high-volume vehicles are now complete.
