# Archive Overview

This directory stores historical status reports, session summaries, and other agent-produced notes that previously lived in the project root. The files are preserved for reference but are no longer part of the primary onboarding documentation.

- `agent_notes/`: Legacy agent handoffs, completion reports, and quick-reference guides. Check these if you need past context or change history.

Nothing in this archive is required for day-to-day operation of the app. Start with the root `README.md` and the docs highlighted there, then refer to this archive only when you need additional historical detail.
