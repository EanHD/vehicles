## üí° Usage Tips

### For Mobile Mechanics

1. **Pre-generate common docs before going offline:**
   - Use the Browse Cache page to see what's cached
   - Generate docs for common vehicles you service
   - Cached docs work without internet!

2. **Quick document access:**
   - Bookmark your Tailscale URL
   - Add to phone home screen
   - Access from any device on your network

3. **Download for offline use:**
   - Download HTML files to phone/tablet
   - Open in any browser (no internet needed)
   - Professional enough to show customers

### Cost Optimization

**Free operations:**
- ‚úÖ Viewing cached documents (instant)
- ‚úÖ Browsing cache index
- ‚úÖ Statistics page
- ‚úÖ Settings page

**Paid operations:**
- üí∞ Generating NEW documents (~$0.05-0.20 per doc)
- üí∞ AI Assistant questions (~$0.01-0.05 per question)

**Cost reduction strategies:**
1. Generate once, use many times (cache FTW!)
2. Pre-generate for common vehicles
3. Use AI Assistant sparingly (or use cached context)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Edit `.env` file to customize AI providers:

```bash
# Research AI (for finding information)
RESEARCH_AI_PROVIDER=perplexity
RESEARCH_AI_MODEL=sonar-pro
RESEARCH_TEMPERATURE=0.2
RESEARCH_MAX_TOKENS=4000

# Formatter AI (for generating HTML)
FORMATTER_AI_PROVIDER=openai
FORMATTER_AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
FORMATTER_TEMPERATURE=0.3
FORMATTER_MAX_TOKENS=8000
```

### Recommended Configurations

**Best Quality (Production):**
```bash
RESEARCH_AI_PROVIDER=perplexity  # Web-connected, accurate
FORMATTER_AI_PROVIDER=openai     # Clean formatting
```
Cost: ~$0.05-0.20 per document

**Budget Option (Testing):**
```bash
RESEARCH_AI_PROVIDER=openai      # GPT-4 Turbo via OpenRouter
FORMATTER_AI_PROVIDER=openai     # GPT-4o-mini
```
Cost: ~$0.02-0.10 per document

## üì° Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Access (Tailscale)

**Best for:** Single mechanic or small shop

```bash
# Start the app
streamlit run app.py

# Access from any device on your Tailscale network
http://[your-tailscale-ip]:8501
```

**Pros:**
- Simple setup
- Secure (Tailscale encrypted)
- No public hosting costs
- Works from anywhere (Tailscale is always on)

**Cons:**
- Requires Tailscale on all devices
- Main machine must be running

### Option 2: Cloud Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

**Best for:** Multiple mechanics or business use

1. Push code to GitHub repo
2. Connect to Streamlit Cloud (free tier available)
3. Set environment secrets
4. Get public URL: `https://yourapp.streamlit.app`

**Pros:**
- Always available
- No local machine needed
- Automatic HTTPS
- Easy sharing

**Cons:**
- Requires GitHub account
- Limited free tier
- API keys stored in cloud

### Option 3: Self-Hosted (Docker)

**Best for:** Shop with dedicated server

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t swoop-service-auto .

# Run container
docker run -p 8501:8501 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/service_docs:/app/service_docs \
  swoop-service-auto
```

**Pros:**
- Full control
- Can run on shop server
- Persistent cache storage

**Cons:**
- Requires Docker knowledge
- More maintenance

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### API Keys

- **Never commit .env file to git**
- Use Streamlit secrets for cloud deployment
- Rotate keys periodically

### Access Control

- Use Tailscale for private access
- Add Streamlit authentication for cloud deployment
- Consider IP whitelisting for business use

### Data Privacy

- Generated docs stored locally (not sent to cloud)
- Only research queries go to AI providers
- Cache is stored on your machine

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

```bash
# Check Python version (needs 3.8+)
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :8501
```

### AI Connection Errors

```bash
# Test AI connections
cd tools
python ai_client.py test

# Check .env file exists and has keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY
```

### Slow Generation

- **First generation:** Slow (AI research takes 30-60 seconds)
- **Subsequent:** Fast (uses cache)
- **Tip:** Pre-generate common vehicles

### Cache Issues

```bash
# View cache location
ls -lh service_docs/

# Check cache index
cat service_docs/cache_index.json | jq 'length'

# Clear cache (if needed)
rm -rf service_docs/*
```
