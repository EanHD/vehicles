# Service Documentation System - Implementation Guide
**From Dataset to Professional Repair Information Platform**

## 🎯 What We Built

You now have a complete AI-powered service documentation system that:

✅ **Generates professional repair procedures** on-demand  
✅ **Caches all documentation** (no repeated API costs)  
✅ **Provides torque specifications** with imperial + metric  
✅ **Includes electrical diagnostics** with wire colors and test procedures  
✅ **Builds institutional knowledge** over time  
✅ **Replaces expensive subscriptions** (ALLDATA, ProDemand)

## 📊 Your Current Dataset

```
✅ 2,246 vehicle entries (makes, models, engines, transmissions)
✅ 153 service definitions (brake work, oil changes, etc.)
✅ Complete coverage of major North American manufacturers
✅ Brass-era vehicles through current EVs (1910s-2025)
```

## 🔧 System Components

### 3. Cache System (`service_docs/`)

Automatically generated directory structure:
```
service_docs/
├── [make]/
│   └── [model]_[year]/
│       ├── [service1].json
│       ├── [service2].json
│       └── ...
```

**Benefits**:
- First lookup: 5-30 seconds (AI research)
- Subsequent lookups: Instant (cached file)
- Zero API cost for cached documents
- Builds over time as you work

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

**Optional enhancements**:
```bash
# For future web interface
pip install flask requests beautifulsoup4

# For advanced JSON manipulation
pip install jq
```

### Step 2: Set Up API Key

Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Make it permanent
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Windows PowerShell**:
```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Make it permanent (system-wide)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY', 'your-key-here', 'User')
```

### Step 3: Test the System

```bash
cd research_tools

# Run the test script to see examples
./quick_test.sh

# Try generating your first document
python service_doc_generator.py 2020 Toyota Camry "Oil and Filter Change"
```

### Step 4: Verify Output

```bash
# Check the cached document
ls -la ../service_docs/toyota/camry_2020/

# View the JSON (pretty-printed)
cat ../service_docs/toyota/camry_2020/oil_and_filter_change.json | jq .

# Try accessing it again (instant cached retrieval)
python service_doc_generator.py 2020 Toyota Camry "Oil and Filter Change"
```

## 💼 Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer Quote Request

**Customer Call**: "How much to replace front brake pads on my 2020 Silverado?"

**Your Process**:
```bash
# Generate service documentation
python service_doc_generator.py 2020 Chevrolet "Silverado 1500" "Brake Pads Replacement (Front)"

# Review output:
# - Labor time: 1.5 hours
# - Parts needed: Brake pads ($50-120), brake cleaner, grease
# - Difficulty: Moderate
# - Mobile suitable: Yes
```

**Your Quote**:
- Labor: 1.5 hours × $100/hr = $150
- Parts: Brake pads ($80) + supplies ($15) = $95
- **Total: $245**

**Customer approves → You arrive with documentation on tablet/phone**

---

### Scenario 2: Unfamiliar Vehicle Diagnosis

**Customer**: "My 2018 Honda Civic won't start - turns over but no fire"

**Your Process**:
```bash
# Check for codes first (OBD2 scanner)
# Code P0230 - Fuel pump relay circuit malfunction

# Get electrical diagnostics
python wiring_diagram_helper.py 2018 Honda Civic "fuel pump relay" "no start"

# System returns:
# - Relay location: Under-hood fuse box, position 15
# - Fuse: 15A in position 20
# - Wire colors: White/Black from relay to pump
# - Test procedure: Check voltage at relay coil (battery voltage key-on)
```

**Diagnosis**: Follow test procedure, find relay not clicking  
**Fix**: Replace fuel pump relay ($15 part, 5 minutes)  
**Invoice**: $75 diagnostic + $40 labor + $15 part = $130

---

### Scenario 3: Complex Repair Decision

**Customer**: "I hear a rattling noise on cold starts - think it's the timing chain?"

**Your Process**:
```bash
# Vehicle: 2015 Ford F-150 3.5L EcoBoost (known timing chain issues)

# Generate service documentation
python service_doc_generator.py 2015 Ford "F-150" "Timing Chain Replacement"

# Review output:
# - Labor time: 8-12 hours (COMPLEX)
# - Special tools: Cam holding tools, timing chain tensioner tool
# - Mobile suitable: NO (engine work too extensive)
# - Parts: Timing chain kit ($400-800), gaskets, fluids
```

**Your Decision**:
- Too complex for mobile service
- Refer to shop partner
- Provide documentation for shop (establishes credibility)
- Earn referral fee

---

### Scenario 4: Quick Torque Spec Lookup

**Mid-job**: "What's the wheel lug nut torque on this F-150?"

**Your Process**:
```bash
python torque_spec_finder.py 2019 Ford F-150 "wheel lug nuts"

# System returns:
# - Torque: 150 ft-lbs (203 Nm)
# - Pattern: Star pattern, two-stage tightening
# - Warning: Check after 50-100 miles
```

**You**: Torque to spec, document on work order, remind customer to recheck

## 🔒 Quality Control Process

### 1. Initial Generation
- AI generates documentation
- Marked as "Pending human verification"
- Contains comprehensive research from multiple sources

### 2. Field Testing
- Technician uses documentation for actual repair
- Notes any errors, omissions, or improvements
- Compares AI specs to actual measurements

### 3. Verification
- Update document with corrections
- Add real-world tips and tricks
- Mark as "Verified" with technician name and date

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Customer feedback on repair quality
- Post-repair follow-up (re-torque wheels, etc.)
- Update documentation with lessons learned

### Example Verification Workflow:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "review_status": "Verified",
    "verified_by": "Mike Smith",
    "verification_date": "2025-01-20",
    "field_notes": "Torque specs confirmed accurate. Added note about seized caliper slide pins common on high-mileage units. Customer satisfied with brake feel.",
    "real_world_time": "1.2 hours (estimate was 1.5 hours)"
  }
}
```

## 🎓 Training New Technicians

### Advantage: Built-in Training Material

Your cached documentation becomes a training library:

**Scenario**: New tech needs to learn brake service

**Process**:
1. Read cached documentation for common vehicles
2. Shadow experienced tech using procedure
3. Perform service independently with doc as reference
4. Verify understanding with quality check

**Benefit**: Consistent procedures, faster training, documented standards

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable not set"
**Solution**:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# Make permanent: add to ~/.bashrc
```

### Issue: "Vehicle not found in database"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if vehicle exists
grep -i "2020.*toyota.*camry" ../vehicles.json

# Try variations: "Camry" vs "CAMRY" vs "camry"
# Try generation codes: "Camry (XV70)" vs just "Camry"
```

### Issue: "Service not found in catalog"
**Solution**:
```bash
# List available services
jq '.[].name' ../services.json

# Try exact service name from list
```

### Issue: "AI generated incorrect specifications"
**Fix**:
1. Add note to cached document: `"needs_verification": true`
2. Research correct spec from factory manual
3. Update cached document
4. Mark as verified

### Issue: "JSON parsing error"
**Fix**:
- AI sometimes adds markdown formatting
- System creates fallback with raw text
- Review output and manually structure if needed
