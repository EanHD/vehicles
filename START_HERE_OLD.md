## 🎯 Common Tasks

### Generate a Document (CLI)

```bash
python tools/service_doc_generator.py \
  --year 2020 \

```

## 💡 Quick Tips

### Cost Optimization

**Tip #1: Cache is Free**
- First generation: $0.01-0.06 (30-60 seconds)
- Every subsequent use: FREE (<1 second)

**Tip #2: Pre-Generate Common Vehicles**
```bash
python tools/batch_generate.py --max 50
```
Spend $1-3 now, save forever!

**Tip #3: Share Cache with Team**
- Cache is just files in `service_docs/`
- Copy to other machines
- Everyone benefits!

### Mobile Access

**Tip #1: Use Tailscale**
```bash
# Get your IP
tailscale ip -4

# Access from phone
http://[your-ip]:8501
```

**Tip #2: Bookmark on Phone**
- Open in Safari/Chrome
- "Add to Home Screen"
- Acts like native app!

**Tip #3: Download for Offline**
- Generate document
- Click "Download HTML"
- Open anytime (no internet needed)

### Quality Assurance

**Tip #1: Always Verify Torque Specs**
- AI research is good, but double-check critical values
- Cross-reference with factory manual when possible

**Tip #2: Use Citations**
- Documents include source citations
- Follow links to verify information

**Tip #3: Report Issues**
- If something seems wrong, verify and note it
- Can regenerate with `--force` flag

## ❓ Quick Troubleshooting

### Web App Won't Start

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try again
./start_web_app.sh
```

### API Connection Failed

```bash
# Test connections
python tools/ai_client.py test

# Check .env file
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Make sure keys are valid (no spaces, full key)
nano .env
```

### Generation is Slow

**First time:** Expected (30-60 seconds for AI research)
**Every time:** Check internet connection, verify API provider status

### Cache Not Working

```bash
# Check cache exists
ls -lh service_docs/

# Rebuild index
rm service_docs/cache_index.json
# Restart web app
```
