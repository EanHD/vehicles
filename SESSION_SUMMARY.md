# 🚗 Session Summary - Path Fix & System Verification
**Date**: January 17, 2025  
**Agent**: Claude (Anthropic)  
**Session Goal**: Fix path issues and get Swoop Service Auto running

---

## ✅ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

### What Was Broken
- **Error**: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../data/vehicles.json'`
- **Cause**: Relative paths (`../data/...`) don't work when app runs from project root
- **Impact**: Streamlit app couldn't start, database files couldn't load

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ **tools/service_doc_generator.py** - Main generator now uses absolute paths
2. ✅ **research_tools/service_doc_generator.py** - Legacy version updated  
3. ✅ **tools/example_usage.py** - Example script cleaned up
4. ✅ **All paths** now resolve correctly from any working directory

### Technical Details
```python
# BEFORE (broken):
def __init__(self, vehicles_db="../data/vehicles.json", ...):
    with open(vehicles_db, 'r') as f:  # ❌ Fails if CWD is wrong
        ...

# AFTER (fixed):
def __init__(self, vehicles_db=None, ...):
    project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent
    if vehicles_db is None:
        vehicles_db = str(project_root / "data" / "vehicles.json")
    with open(vehicles_db, 'r') as f:  # ✅ Always works
        ...
```
