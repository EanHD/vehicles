# Session Completion Report - January 17, 2025

## 🎯 Session Summary

This session focused on cleaning up the document regeneration system, fixing bugs in the cache management, and improving the overall workflow for generating service documentation.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. **Fixed Diagram Generation System** ⚙️

**Problem**: Diagram generation was enabled by default but producing low-quality results that didn't match professional standards.

**Solution**:
- Changed default behavior to **disable diagrams** (`enable_diagrams=False`)
- Diagrams are now optional and must be explicitly enabled
- When disabled, no placeholder or error images appear in documents
- Updated documentation to reflect diagram generation is experimental

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/service_doc_generator.py` - Changed default parameter

**Impact**: Documents now generate cleanly without placeholder or broken diagram images.

---

### 2. **Created Document Regeneration Script** 🔄

**What**: Built `regenerate_docs.py` to easily regenerate all cached service documents.

**Features**:
- Regenerates 6 common vehicle/service combinations
- Shows progress and success/failure for each document
- Useful after template updates or AI prompt improvements
- Runs with diagrams disabled for production quality

**Documents Generated**:
1. 2020 Toyota Camry - Oil Change
2. 2019 Honda Accord - Oil Change
3. 2021 Ford F-150 - Oil Change
4. 2020 Toyota Camry - Brake Pad Replacement
5. 2019 Honda Accord - Alternator Replacement
6. 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 - Battery Replacement

**Usage**:
```bash
cd /home/eanhd/projects/vehicles
source venv/bin/activate
python3 regenerate_docs.py
```

**Files Created**:
- `regenerate_docs.py` - New regeneration script

---

### 3. **Fixed Cache Management in Streamlit App** 🐛

**Problems Fixed**:

**A. Deleted documents still appearing in cache**
- **Issue**: When documents were deleted from disk, they still showed in the Browse Cache page
- **Fix**: Added cache index reload in `browse_cache_page()` to verify files still exist
- **Fix**: Filter out deleted files before displaying in the UI

**B. Cache stats not updating after deletion**
- **Issue**: Sidebar stats showed old cache count after deletions
- **Fix**: Added `gen._load_cache_index()` in sidebar stats section
- **Result**: Stats now update immediately after any cache changes

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` - Updated `browse_cache_page()` and sidebar stats

**Impact**: Cache management now works reliably - deleted files don't show up, stats are accurate.

---

### 4. **Updated Documentation** 📖

**README.md Updates**:
- Added section on managing cached documents
- Documented regeneration script usage
- Clarified diagram generation is disabled by default
- Updated .env configuration examples with current AI provider setup
- Added note about document deletion workflow
