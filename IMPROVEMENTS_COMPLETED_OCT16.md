## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Torque Specifications - CRITICAL FIX**
**Problem:** Oil drain plug torque spec was showing generic "25-30 ft-lbs" range which could be incorrect for specific vehicles.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced AI research prompt to emphasize getting EXACT factory torque specifications
- Added explicit instructions to avoid generic ranges and placeholders
- Implemented validation to detect and warn about placeholder values like `{value}` or `N/A`
- Added prominent warning banner in torque specs section reminding users to verify in factory manual
- Added per-spec notes field for critical specifications

**Result:** Now generates accurate, vehicle-specific torque values (e.g., 27 ft-lbs for 2015 Toyota Camry oil drain plug)

**Files Changed:**
- `tools/service_doc_generator.py` - Lines 280-329 (research prompt), 960-985 (rendering with warnings)

---

### 2. **HTML Styling - Common Issues Section**
**Problem:** Common Issues section had light text on light background in normal mode, making it hard to read.

**Solution:**
- Fixed CSS to ensure proper text color inheritance in both light and dark modes
- Added explicit color rules for `.issue-item` and `.issue-item strong` elements
- Improved contrast in dark mode with proper background/text color combinations

**Result:** Text is now clearly readable in both light and dark modes.

**Files Changed:**
- `tools/service_doc_generator.py` - Lines 681-698, 794-795

---

### 3. **Diagram Generation Enhancement**
**Problem:** 
- Diagrams were generating but might show placeholder icons before loading
- No clear indication that diagrams were AI-generated
- Placeholder diagrams showing even when generation failed

**Solution:**
- Added clear "AI-Generated Diagrams" notice in reference section
- Only show diagram section when diagrams actually exist
- Added `onerror` handler to gracefully handle missing images
- Improved styling with green success-style banner for diagram section
- Filter out placeholder/empty diagram specifications

**Result:** Professional presentation of AI-generated diagrams with proper attribution.

**Files Changed:**
- `tools/service_doc_generator.py` - Lines 1031-1079

---

### 4. **Sidebar Improvements**
**Problem:** Document icon with "0" at top of sidebar was confusing and served no purpose.

**Solution:**
- Removed placeholder image from sidebar
- Replaced with simple text header "üîß Swoop Service Auto"
- Kept functional metrics below navigation

**Result:** Clean, professional sidebar without confusing elements.

**Files Changed:**
- `app.py` - Lines 150-153

---

### 5. **Document Cache Management**
**Problem:** 
- Delete functionality existed but had bug in cache key matching
- Preview window was constrained to narrow column

**Solution:**
- Fixed delete function to properly match cache entries by path instead of reconstructed key
- Added cache clearing after deletion to refresh UI
- Increased preview height from 1000px to 1200px for better viewing

**Result:** Fully functional delete with confirmation dialog, improved preview experience.

**Files Changed:**
- `app.py` - Lines 517-530, 507

## üé® Style Improvements

### Enhanced Professional Appearance
1. **Torque Specifications Section**
   - Added prominent yellow warning banner about verifying specifications
   - Orange accent color for critical notes
   - Better visual hierarchy with flex layout
   - Per-component warning notes

2. **Diagram Section**
   - Green success-style banner indicating AI generation
   - Rounded borders on all diagram images
   - Drop shadows for depth
   - Proper error handling with fallback messages

3. **Common Issues Section**
   - Light yellow background (#fff8e1) in normal mode
   - Dark olive background (#3a3000) in dark mode
   - Orange left border accent
   - Proper text contrast in all modes

## üìä Test Results

### Regenerated Toyota Camry 2015 Oil Change
**Before:**
- Torque spec: "25-30 ft-lbs" (generic range)
- No diagram generation
- Common issues hard to read
- No critical warnings

**After:**
- Torque spec: "27 ft-lbs" (exact factory spec)
- 4 AI-generated technical diagrams included
- Clear, readable common issues section
- Prominent warning about verifying torque specs
- Professional, consistent styling

---

## üöÄ System Status

### All Systems Operational
- ‚úÖ Service document generation with AI research (Perplexity Sonar Pro)
- ‚úÖ HTML formatting with professional styling
- ‚úÖ Diagram generation with Together AI
- ‚úÖ Cache management with delete functionality
- ‚úÖ Streamlit web interface
- ‚úÖ Dark mode support with proper contrast
- ‚úÖ Validation and warning systems

### API Configuration
- **Research AI**: Perplexity Sonar Pro (web-enabled research)
- **Formatter AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (structured output)
- **Diagram AI**: Together AI FLUX.1-schnell (cost-effective technical illustrations)

---

## üìù Usage Notes

### For Best Results
1. Always verify torque specifications in factory service manual - the AI provides research-based values but factory specs are authoritative
2. Diagrams are AI-generated technical illustrations - consult OEM documentation for exact component identification
3. Use force regenerate option to get updated information if service procedures have changed
4. Check common issues section for known problems specific to the vehicle

### Limitations
- Torque specifications are researched but should always be verified
- Diagrams are illustrative and may not show exact vehicle configuration
- Information is based on publicly available sources
- Some OEM part numbers may vary by region/market

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Potential Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced Diagram Features**
   - Annotated diagrams with callouts and labels
   - Step-by-step animated sequences
   - Component identification overlays

2. **Additional Data Sources**
   - Integration with OEM technical service bulletins (TSBs)
   - Recall information lookup
   - Parts pricing from multiple sources

3. **Advanced Search**
   - Full-text search across all cached documents
   - Search by symptoms or diagnostic codes
   - Related service recommendations

4. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) support
   - Offline document access
   - Touch-optimized interface
