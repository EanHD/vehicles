## What Was Accomplished Today

### Gap Analysis & Completion
After completing all manufacturers per CHECKLIST.md, conducted comprehensive gap analysis to identify commonly-serviced vehicles missing from dataset.

### Critical Additions Made (10 entries)
1. **Dodge Dakota** - Added ALL missing generations (1987-2011)
2. **Dodge Ram HD** - Added 2500/3500 historical coverage with Cummins diesel
3. **Dodge Ram Van** - Added B-series commercial van (1971-2003)
4. **Toyota Sequoia** - Filled 14-year gap (2nd gen 2008-2022)
5. **Mercedes Sprinter** - Added current generation (2019-2025)
6. **Mercedes Metris** - Added midsize commercial van
7. **Ford EcoSport** - Added recent subcompact crossover

### Why These Matter
These vehicles are **extremely common in mobile mechanic service bays**:
