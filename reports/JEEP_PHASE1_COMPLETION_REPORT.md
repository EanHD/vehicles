## Workflow Adherence

This research followed the 5-phase workflow:

1. ✅ **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Created `wip/jeep/` directory and `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
2. ✅ **Phase 2 (Research)**: Researched models decade-by-decade using Wikipedia
3. ✅ **Phase 3 (Validation)**: Validated all JSON files with `jq empty`
4. ✅ **Phase 4 (Append)**: Merged validated decade files to `vehicles.json` with backup
5. ✅ **Phase 5 (Completion)**: Created this report and updated tracking files

---

## Recommendations

1. **Phase 2 Priority**: Low-medium. Jeep's historic vehicles (1940s-1970s) include iconic models like the Willys MB and early CJ series, but have lower service volume than modern vehicles.

2. **Next Manufacturer**: Consider Ram (2009-present) or Dodge trucks/SUVs to complete Stellantis coverage alongside Jeep and Chrysler.

3. **Data Maintenance**: No immediate updates needed. Monitor for new Jeep releases (Recon EV planned for 2024-2025).

---

## Files Modified

- ✅ `vehicles.json` - Added 48 Jeep entries (backup created)
- ✅ `wip/jeep/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - Updated to reflect completion
- ✅ `wip/jeep/*.json` - Archived as `*_APPENDED.json`
- ⏳ `CHECKLIST_STATUS.md` - To be updated

---

## Conclusion

Jeep Phase 1 successfully added comprehensive coverage of modern Jeep vehicles from 1980-2025. The dataset now includes iconic off-road vehicles (Wrangler, CJ series), luxury SUVs (Grand Cherokee, Wagoneer), compact crossovers (Compass, Renegade), and emerging electrified models (4xe variants).

**Phase 1 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Ready for Phase 2**: Yes (when prioritized)
