## Recommendations

### For CHECKLIST_STATUS.md
**Do NOT mark GMC as complete yet** - Phase 1 (1980s-2020s) is complete, but Phase 2 (1910s-1970s historic/commercial) remains pending. GMC should only be marked complete in CHECKLIST_STATUS.md after Phase 2 is researched and appended.

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Phase 1 complete (33 models appended)
2. ⏳ Decision point: Continue to Phase 2 (GMC historic) or move to next manufacturer
3. ⏳ If moving to next manufacturer, follow same organized workflow:
   - Verify CHECKLIST.md completeness
   - Create wip/[manufacturer]/ directory
   - Create PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
   - Research decade-by-decade
   - Validate and append when complete

---

## Conclusion

GMC Phase 1 research successfully completed using the organized decade-based workflow. All 33 modern consumer vehicles (1980s-2020s) are now documented in vehicles.json with:
- ✅ Complete Wikipedia citations
- ✅ Accurate technical specifications
- ✅ Justified difficulty modifiers
- ✅ Platform sharing documentation
- ✅ Validated JSON structure
- ✅ Trackable progress indicators

The systematic approach proved effective for maintaining organization and preventing data loss. Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (historic/commercial) or transition to next manufacturer as directed.
