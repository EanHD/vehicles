## Key Insights

### Defunct Brand Patterns
1. **Economic downturn impact**: Hummer (2010) killed by recession + fuel prices
2. **Market consolidation**: Scion (2016) absorbed back into Toyota
3. **Niche market failure**: Isuzu/Suzuki couldn't compete in US small car market
4. **Platform sharing increase**: Late models heavily rebadged (GM, Nissan partnerships)

### Platform Sharing Evolution
- **Early period**: Independent designs (H1, Samurai, Trooper)
- **Mid period**: Some sharing (Rodeo/Passport)
- **Late period**: Heavy rebadging (Ascender, XL7, Equator, Forenza)

### US Market Challenges
- **Fuel economy**: Hummer couldn't meet CAFE standards
- **Youth market**: Scion failed to differentiate from Toyota
- **Small car competition**: Isuzu/Suzuki lost to Honda/Toyota/Nissan
- **Brand recognition**: Lack of marketing budget vs. established brands
