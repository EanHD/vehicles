## Platform Naming Clarification

**GMT400** is listed in CHECKLIST.md as a standalone entry but is actually a platform designation covered by multiple vehicle entries in vehicles.json:
- C/K Series (Fourth generation GMT400) [1988-2000]
- Suburban (GMT400 eighth generation) [1992-1999]
- Tahoe (First generation GMT400) [1995-2000]

This is not a gap but rather comprehensive generational documentation that exceeds the checklist requirement.

---

## Data Quality Verification

✅ **JSON Validation**: `jq empty vehicles.json` passes
✅ **Required Fields**: All entries contain years, make, model, engines, transmissions, region, drivetrain, body_styles, hybrid, diesel, difficulty_modifier, notes
✅ **Difficulty Modifiers**: All ≥ 1.00 with justification in notes
✅ **Citations**: Wikipedia URLs and revision dates documented
✅ **No Duplicates**: Each generation has distinct entry

## Workflow Implementation

The following organizational infrastructure has been established:

### 1. Directory Structure
```
wip/
├── chevrolet/
│   ├── models_in_vehicles_json.txt
│   ├── gap_check.py
│   └── GAP_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md (archived)
├── gmc/
├── buick/
└── ... (other manufacturers)
```

### 2. Documentation Files Created
- **WORKFLOW.md**: Comprehensive step-by-step process for manufacturer completion
- **CHEVROLET_GAP_ANALYSIS.md**: Template for future gap analyses
- **CHEVROLET_COMPLETION_REPORT.md**: This document

### 3. Validation Tools
- `gap_check.py`: Automated comparison script
- `jq` validation commands documented in WORKFLOW.md

## Recommendations for Next Manufacturer

Based on this successful Chevrolet completion, the workflow for GMC (next in CHECKLIST_STATUS.md) should be:

1. ✅ Create `wip/gmc/` working directory
2. ✅ Extract GMC models from vehicles.json
3. ✅ Run gap analysis script (adapt gap_check.py)
4. ✅ Create decade JSON files for missing models only
5. ✅ Validate with `jq empty`
6. ✅ Append to vehicles.json
7. ✅ Mark complete in CHECKLIST_STATUS.md
