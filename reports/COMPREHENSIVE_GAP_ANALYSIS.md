# Comprehensive Gap Analysis - Real-World Field Vehicles
**Date**: January 17, 2025
**Purpose**: Identify commonly serviced vehicles missing from dataset

## Analysis Methodology
1. Check each manufacturer for common models mechanics encounter
2. Verify decade coverage (especially 2010s-2020s for high-volume vehicles)
3. Identify popular variants/trims that may be missing
4. Focus on high-service-frequency vehicles

## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. Ram Trucks - MAJOR GAP
**Current Coverage**: Only 7 entries
- 1500 DS/DT (2010s-2020s)
- 2500/3500 HD (2010s-2020s)
- ProMaster/ProMaster City

**Missing Historical Models** (Extremely common in field):
- **2nd Gen (1994-2001)**: BR/BE platform, Cummins 5.9L diesel era
- **3rd Gen (2002-2008)**: DR/DH platform, first coil spring suspension
- **Dakota (1987-2011)**: Midsize pickup, very common
- **1980s-1990s Ramcharger**: SUV variant
- **Ram Van/Wagon (1970s-2003)**: B-series commercial vans

**Priority**: HIGH - These are everywhere in service bays

### 2. Common Import Gaps

#### Toyota - Missing Generations
**Current**: 55 entries but need to verify:
- **4Runner** - All generations covered?
- **Sequoia** - First gen (2001-2007) vs. current
- **Sienna** - Hybrid emphasis
- **Highlander** - Multiple generations

#### Honda - Missing Generations
**Current**: 56 entries but need to verify:
- **Ridgeline** - First gen (2006-2014) vs. current
- **Passport** - Current generation (2019+)
- **Odyssey** - Multiple generations

### 3. Domestic Gaps

#### Chevrolet/GMC - Verify Coverage
- **Express/Savana full-size vans** (current GMT610)
- **City Express** (2015-2018 small van)
- **Bolt EUV** (separate from Bolt EV)

#### Ford - Verify Coverage  
- **Transit** (2015-present full-size van)
- **Transit Connect** (2010-2023 small van)
- **EcoSport** (2018-2022)
- **Edge** (2007-present) - multiple generations

### 4. Luxury Brand Gaps

#### Verify BMW Coverage
**Current**: 68 entries - appears comprehensive but check:
- **X2/X4** coverage complete?
- **Recent LCI (facelift) variants** documented?

#### Verify Mercedes Coverage  
**Current**: 74 entries - check for:
- **Sprinter vans** (2019+ generation)
- **Metris** (2016-2023 midsize van)

### 5. Commercial/Fleet Vehicles

**High Priority Missing**:
- **Ford Transit** (ubiquitous commercial van)
- **Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana** (still in production)
- **Nissan NV** series (NV200/NV1500/NV2500/NV3500)
- **Mercedes Sprinter** (2019+ generation)
- **Ram ProMaster** - verify all variants

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Ram historical coverage (1990s-2000s)
2. **Commercial Vehicles**: Transit, Express/Savana, NV series
3. **Verification Pass**: Check existing manufacturers for missing generations
4. **Variant Check**: Ensure major trim differences are documented

## Research Strategy

For each gap:
1. Create wip directory if needed
2. Research Wikipedia for generation details
3. Add entries with proper citations
4. Validate and append

**Start with Ram - it's the biggest gap for common service vehicles.**
