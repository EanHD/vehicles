## What Changed

### Disabled Features
- ‚ùå AI-generated technical diagrams
- ‚ùå Diagram placeholders in HTML
- ‚ùå Diagram API costs

### What Still Works
- ‚úÖ AI-powered research (Perplexity Sonar Pro)
- ‚úÖ Professional formatting (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)
- ‚úÖ Accurate torque specifications
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step procedures with timing
- ‚úÖ Parts information and specifications
- ‚úÖ Safety warnings and troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Beautiful HTML styling
- ‚úÖ Cache system for instant retrieval
- ‚úÖ Streamlit web interface

## Test Results

```bash
‚úÖ Generator initialized successfully
‚úÖ Diagram generator: None (disabled)
‚úÖ Cache cleared: 0 documents
‚úÖ System ready for clean document generation
```

## Files Modified

1. **`.env`** - Set `DIAGRAM_AI_PROVIDER=` (empty)
2. **`README.md`** - Removed diagram feature references
3. **Cache cleared** - All old documents with diagrams removed
4. **`service_docs/diagrams/`** - Deleted

## New Documentation

1. **`DIAGRAM_DECISION.md`** - Full explanation of why diagrams were disabled
2. **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** - User-friendly summary of changes
3. **`STATUS.md`** - This file (system status)

## How to Use

### Start the Web App
```bash
cd /home/eanhd/projects/vehicles
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run app.py
```

### Generate Service Documentation
1. Open http://localhost:8501
2. Select Make ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Year
3. Choose Service
4. Click "Generate Service Documentation"
5. Get clean, professional docs in 10-30 seconds

## Expected Behavior

When you generate a new document, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Clean HTML without diagram placeholders
- ‚úÖ Professional step-by-step procedures
- ‚úÖ Accurate torque specifications
- ‚úÖ Parts information
- ‚úÖ Safety warnings
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting tips

## If You Want to Re-enable Diagrams

See `DIAGRAM_DECISION.md` for instructions on how to:
- Re-enable Together AI ($0.005/diagram)
- Re-enable OpenAI DALL-E ($0.02-0.04/diagram)
- Re-enable Stability AI (moderate cost)

**Note**: Only re-enable if you're willing to accept lower quality diagrams and additional costs.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test Generation**: Generate 2-3 service documents to verify quality
2. **Check Specifications**: Verify torque specs are accurate
3. **Review HTML**: Ensure formatting is clean and professional
4. **Verify Cache**: Documents should be cached for instant retrieval

## System Health

- **Database**: 2,270 vehicles loaded ‚úÖ
- **Services**: 153 service types available ‚úÖ
- **AI Clients**: Perplexity + OpenAI configured ‚úÖ
- **Web App**: Ready to run ‚úÖ
- **Cache**: Clean and ready ‚úÖ

## Cost Estimate

**Per New Document**:
- Research AI: ~$0.001-0.003
- Formatting AI: ~$0.005-0.015
- **Total**: ~$0.01-0.02 per new document
- **Cached**: $0.00 (instant!)

**Savings from disabling diagrams**: ~$0.005-0.04 per document
