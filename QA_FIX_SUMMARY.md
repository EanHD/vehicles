# QA Audit System Fixed - January 17, 2025

## Summary
Fixed the HTML QA audit system that was incorrectly flagging all generated service documents. All 8 existing cached documents now pass QA checks.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Section IDs** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** QA was looking for sections that don't always exist
- Required `id="fluids"` - but only rendered when service involves fluids
- Required `id="variants"` - but only rendered when platform differences exist  
- Required `id="revision"` - this section never existed

**Solution:**
- Split sections into **required** (core) and **optional**
- Required core sections: overview, safety, steps, torque-specifications, parts, consumables, tools, troubleshooting, provenance
- Optional sections: fluids, variants, reference-diagrams (only rendered when data exists)
- Removed non-existent "revision" section from requirements

### 2. **False Emoji Detection** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Warning symbol ⚠ was being flagged as an emoji

**Solution:**
- Updated emoji regex to exclude acceptable technical symbols
- Warning ⚠, checkmarks ✓✗, and lightning ⚡ are now allowed
- Only actual Unicode emojis (😀🔧🚗 etc.) are flagged

### 3. **Overly Strict Torque Unit Checking** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** QA required exact format `27 ft-lbs (37 Nm)` but variations existed

**Solution:**
- More lenient checking - looks for "Nm" or "N·m" anywhere in torque section
- Recognizes various formats: `27 ft-lbs (37 Nm)`, `27 ft-lb (37Nm)`, etc.
- Still warns if no metric units found at all

### 4. **Research Prompt Missing Data Fields** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** AI wasn't being asked to provide fluids, variants, or consumables data

**Solution:**
- Updated research prompt to explicitly request:
  - `fluids`: Fluid specifications and capacities (when relevant)
  - `consumables`: Shop supplies needed (rags, cleaners, O-rings)
  - `variants`: Platform/VIN/production date differences
- Provided comprehensive JSON example showing expected structure
- Emphasized dual-unit torque specs: `"27 ft-lbs (37 Nm)"`

## QA Test Results

Ran QA audit on all 8 cached service documents:

```
✅ BMW/1_Series/2010_Fuel_Injector_Replacement_Set_of_4.html
✅ Chevrolet/Aveo/2007_Alternator_Repair.html
✅ Chevrolet/Silverado_1500/2020_Battery_Replacement.html
✅ Ford/F-150/2021_Oil_Change.html
✅ Honda/Accord/2019_Alternator_Replacement.html
✅ Honda/Accord/2019_Oil_Change.html
✅ Toyota/Camry/2020_Brake_Pad_Replacement.html
✅ Toyota/Camry/2020_Oil_Change.html

Summary: 8 passed, 0 failed out of 8 total
```

## Files Modified

1. **app.py** - Updated `audit_html()` function with smarter section detection
2. **tools/service_doc_generator.py** - Enhanced research prompt with additional data fields
3. **test_qa.py** (new) - Standalone QA testing script for all service documents

## New Features

### Enhanced Research Prompt
The AI now generates more comprehensive service documentation including:
- Dual-unit torque specifications (imperial + metric)
- Fluid specifications with capacities
- Platform variants and VIN splits
- Detailed consumables list
- More accurate OEM part numbers with aftermarket alternatives

### QA Testing Script
Created `test_qa.py` for batch testing all service documents:
```bash
python3 test_qa.py
```

## Impact on New Document Generation

New documents generated will now include:
1. **More complete data** - fluids, variants, consumables when relevant
2. **Better torque specs** - always dual-unit (ft-lbs + Nm)  
3. **Pass QA automatically** - as long as core sections are present
4. **Professional format** - no unwanted emojis, proper structure

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check existing docs**: `python3 test_qa.py` (should show 8/8 passed)
2. **Generate new doc** in Streamlit app
3. **View QA panel** - should show "✅ QA passed" or list specific actionable issues
4. **Test optional sections** - fluids/variants only appear when data exists

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix applied and tested locally
2. ✅ Pushed to GitHub repository  
3. ⏳ Streamlit Cloud will auto-deploy (2-3 minutes)
4. 🎯 Generate a new service document to verify QA works in production
5. 🎯 All future documents should pass QA with comprehensive data

## Technical Details

### QA Audit Logic Flow
```
1. Check H1 count (must be exactly 1)
2. Check required core sections (9 sections)
3. Check optional sections (info only, not failure)
4. Check for emojis (excluding technical symbols)
5. Verify torque table exists if torque section present
6. Verify metric units in torque specs (lenient)
7. Check for duplicate IDs
8. Verify print CSS exists
```

### Section Hierarchy
```
Required Core (9):
├── overview       (vehicle + service info)
├── safety         (warnings and precautions)
├── steps          (procedure steps)
├── torque-specifications (fastener specs)
├── parts          (OEM and aftermarket)
├── consumables    (shop supplies)
├── tools          (special tools needed)
├── troubleshooting (common issues)
└── provenance     (disclaimer and sources)

Optional (3):
├── fluids         (when relevant to service)
├── variants       (when platform differences exist)
└── reference-diagrams (when diagrams generated)
```
