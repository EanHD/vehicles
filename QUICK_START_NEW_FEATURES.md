## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Print button not working?**
A: Check popup blockers. Use "View Full" or "Download" instead.

**Q: How much does wiring research cost?**
A: About $0.001 per circuit. Once cached, it's free to reuse!

**Q: Can I save wiring diagrams?**
A: Yes! All wiring info auto-saves to `wiring_diagrams/` folder.

**Q: Does this replace ALLDATA?**
A: For basic wiring info and service procedures, yes! For dealer-specific TSBs and advanced diagnostics, ALLDATA still has advantages. But this costs pennies vs. $100+/month.

**Q: Works on mobile?**
