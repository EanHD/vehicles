# Back-to-Top Navigation Fix - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Fixed
The "back to top" links in HTML service documentation were causing unwanted page navigation in Streamlit's preview instead of smoothly scrolling to the top of the document.

## ✅ Solution
Added JavaScript event handling and CSS smooth scrolling to properly handle anchor links within the iframe context.
