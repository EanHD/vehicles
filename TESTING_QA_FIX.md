# Testing the QA Fix

## ✅ The Fix Has Been Applied

All changes have been pushed to GitHub and Streamlit Cloud will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes.

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Wait for Deployment
- Go to: https://swoopdata.streamlit.app
- Look for the latest commit timestamp in bottom right
- Should show commit: `3746a61` or later

### 2. Test with Existing Documents (Browse Cache)
1. Click **"📁 Browse Cache"** in sidebar
2. Select any document from the list
3. Click **"View Selected Document"**
4. Look for the QA panel above the action buttons:
   - ✅ **Should show**: "QA passed: headings, sections, torque labels, and IDs look good."
   - ❌ **Should NOT show**: Long list of missing section errors

### 3. Test with New Document Generation
1. Go to **"🔧 Generate Service Docs"** tab
2. Fill in the form:
   - Year: 2020
   - Make: Toyota
   - Model: Camry
   - Engine: Any
   - Transmission: Any
   - Service: **"Oil Change"** (or any service)
3. Click **"Generate Documentation"**
4. Wait for generation (~15-30 seconds)
5. Check the QA panel in results:
   - ✅ Should pass or show specific, actionable issues only
   - ❌ Should NOT show "Missing section id='fluids'" if fluids not relevant
   - ❌ Should NOT show "Missing section id='revision'"

### 4. Verify New Documents Have Better Data

New documents should include (when relevant):

#### Torque Specifications (should have dual units)
```
✅ Good: 27 ft-lbs (37 Nm)
✅ Good: 18 ft-lbs (24 Nm)
❌ Bad: 25-30 ft-lbs
❌ Bad: 27 ft-lbs (no metric)
```

#### Fluids Section (for oil changes, coolant, etc.)
Should see a table with:
- System (e.g., "Engine oil", "Coolant")
- Specification (e.g., "0W-20 Full Synthetic")
- Capacities (Total + Refill)
- Notes

#### Consumables List
Should include shop supplies:
- Shop towels/rags
- Degreaser or brake cleaner
- Nitrile gloves
- Funnel
- Oil absorbent pads
- etc.

#### Variants Section (if applicable)
Should list platform/VIN differences:
- Different part numbers for early/late production
- Hybrid vs non-hybrid differences
- AWD vs FWD differences

## 📊 Expected Results

### For Oil Change Service:
- ✅ QA should pass
- ✅ Should include fluids section (oil specs)
- ✅ Should include consumables (rags, gloves, etc.)
- ✅ May include variants (if hybrid/AWD options exist)
- ✅ Torque specs in dual units

### For Brake Pad Replacement:
- ✅ QA should pass
- ⚠️ Fluids section optional (only if brake fluid mentioned)
- ✅ Should include consumables (brake cleaner, anti-seize, etc.)
- ✅ Should include variants (if different caliper types)
- ✅ Torque specs in dual units

### For Battery Replacement:
- ✅ QA should pass
- ❌ Fluids section unlikely (batteries don't use fluids)
- ✅ Should include consumables (terminal cleaner, anti-corrosion spray)
- ✅ May include variants (different battery sizes/locations)
- ✅ Torque specs in dual units (for terminal bolts)

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Document Still Failing QA?
Check what specific issues are reported:

1. **"Missing section id='[name]'"** 
   - If it's a core section (overview, safety, steps, torque-specifications, parts, consumables, tools, troubleshooting, provenance) → Bug, report it
   - If it's optional (fluids, variants, reference-diagrams) → Bug in QA code, shouldn't fail

2. **"Emojis detected"**
   - Check if actual emojis (😀🔧🚗) in the document
   - Warning symbol ⚠ is OK and shouldn't trigger this

3. **"Torque values should include metric units"**
   - Check the torque table
   - Should have format: `27 ft-lbs (37 Nm)`
   - If it's missing Nm entirely, the AI didn't follow instructions

4. **"No <h1>"** or **"Duplicate IDs"**
   - This is a serious HTML structure issue
   - Check the HTML source

### Clear Steps to Report Issue
1. Note which vehicle/service combination
2. Screenshot the QA error panel
3. Note the generation time (to find logs)
4. Check if it's a cached old document or newly generated

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **All 8 existing cached documents pass QA** (verified locally)
✅ **New documents pass QA** (or show specific actionable issues)
✅ **No false positives** for missing optional sections
✅ **No emoji warnings** for technical symbols (⚠ ⚡ ✓ ✗)
✅ **New documents include fluids/variants/consumables** when relevant
